# ShoppyGeek_Ecom_WebApp
This is the E-commerce web application made it by using Django framework.


Added User registration,login,logout.

Once logged in, users can:

Add products to their shopping cart

Update the quantity, or Remove items

See the total cost

And added Paytm Gateway for checkout.(Here I didn't added any API keys(i.e..at ecomapp/keys.py) so that the payment is not possible if we don't add the Paytm API keys)

The database include models: User, Products and Order,OrderUpdate and Contacts.
